        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

        "Calling `model = model.bind_tools(tool_belt)`, LangGraph (via LangChain/OpenAI’s function‐calling API) injects into the model’s context a list of “functions” (i.e. tools), each with:\n",

        "2. **A description** of what it does\n",
        "3. **A JSON schema** for its arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, when the model processes your user’s query, it “decides” whether it needs a tool by reasoning over that list of functions. In practice:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Semantic matching**: The model compares your request against each tool’s description.\n",
        "* **Function‐calling tokens**: If it determines a tool is needed, it emits a special `{\"name\": \"...\", \"arguments\": { … }}` JSON payload instead of plain text.\n",

        "LangGraph does enforce a cycle (“recursion”) limit on your graph to prevent infinite loops. If we never explicitly set one, it will use its built-in default of 25 super-steps—once that’s hit without reaching your END node, you’ll get a `langgraph.errors.GraphRecursionError: Recursion limit of 25 reached without hitting a stop condition.`\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

        "> NOTE: Alternatively you can suggest where gaps exist in this method.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ✅ Answer\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Allow for synonyms and paraphrases**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * *Why?* Right now the model only passes if it literally contains each string in `must_mention`.  If it writes “low-rank adaptation” as “low rank adaptation” (no hyphen), or says “parameter reduction” instead of “reduce parameters,” it’ll fail even though it got the idea.\n",
        "   * *How?* Before matching, normalize both output and keywords (lowercase, strip punctuation), and expand your keyword list with common synonyms or use a small lexical resource (e.g. WordNet) to accept equivalent terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Stemming or lemmatization**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * *Why?* Plurals and tense changes (“weights” vs. “weight”, “frozen” vs. “freeze”) can trip up exact matches.\n",
        "   * *How?* Run both text and keywords through a stemmer (e.g. Porter) or lemmatizer so “freeze” and “frozen” share a root.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Partial‐credit scoring**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * *Why?* Right now it’s all or nothing: if one keyword is missing, the whole question is “wrong.” That hides gradations in model performance.\n",
        "   * *How?* Instead of requiring 100% of keywords, award 1 point per keyword found. You can report percent-correct or set a threshold (e.g. ≥ 75% of keywords).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Semantic similarity metrics**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * *Why?* Even with synonyms, some correct answers might use completely different phrasing.\n",
        "   * *How?* Compute an embedding of the model’s answer and compare to an embedding of an ideal reference answer (or reference keywords) using cosine similarity. You can set a cutoff (e.g. ≥ 0.7 cosine) as “correct.”\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use multiple reference answers**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * *Why?* There’s often more than one way to express a fact.\n",
        "   * *How?* For each question, collect a small list of human‐written “gold” answers. Then evaluate against all of them, passing if the model’s answer is close enough to any one of them (via BLEU/ROUGE/BERTScore or keyword checks).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Incorporate negative checks**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * *Why?* A model might accidentally mention a keyword in the wrong context (e.g. “LoRA does *not* stand for low-rank adaptation”).\n",

[...] Inspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated.
